# Guessing Game

Guessing Game: Configure the ``application.properties`` file with the subject you want the program to guess. 

Set up the following properties:

- `` guessing.program `` 
  - Name the program.
- `` guessing.welcome `` 
  - Set up a welcome message.
- `` guessing.success ``
  - Set up a message to appear when the program correctly guesses what you were thinking.
- `` guessing.failure ``
  - Set up a message to appear when the program gives up.
- `` guessing.complete ``
  - Set up a message to appear when the program prompts you to complete a sentence. Replace {0} with the last question asked by the program, and {1} with your response. The program will ask you to provide a characteristic that distinguishes your response from the previous question asked.
- `` guessing.root ``
  - Set up an initial question.
- `` guessing.next ``
  - Set up a next question to appear when the first question correctly.
- `` guessing.other ``
  - Set up another question to appear when the first question incorrectly.
